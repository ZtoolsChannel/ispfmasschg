# ISPF Edit Macro Mass Change Facility                                
MASSCHG performs an ISPF Edit Macro against all members or a selection of members of one to four partitioned data sets.                      
                                                                      
Several useful macros are included to perform various functions or to be used as the basis for your own macros.                             
                                                                      
Editing can be performed in either the foreground or in batch.
